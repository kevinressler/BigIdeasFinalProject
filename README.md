### Description and links to the datasets used:
We got our information from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. We looked into the data provided and found three sources that showed the number of various athletic feilds and other places to practice. 

We were also able to not just see how many there were, but in some cases we were able to see what resources the feilds/facilites had available to them that could make the playing experience better and possibly improve athlete performance.

### Overview:

In this project we take data and apply it to each neighborhood in Pittsburgh to find out what the *best neighborhood* would be for a athlete or to become a professional athlete, the more athletic facilities there are the better chance for improvement for that athlete.
